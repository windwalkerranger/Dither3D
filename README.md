# Surface-Stable Fractal Dithering

Surface-Stable Fractal Dithering is a novel form of dithering invented by Rune Skovbo Johansen for use on surfaces in 3D scenes.

What's unique about it is that the dots in the dither patterns stick to surfaces, and yet the dot sizes and spacing remain approximately constant on the screen, even as surfaces move closer by or further away. This is achieved by dynamically adding or removing dots as needed.

Here's a video explaining how it works:

And here's a feature demo video (with music!) showing color RGB dithering, CMYK halftone, true 1-bit low-res effects, and much more:

This repository contains the shader and texture source files, and a Unity example project demonstrating their use. The example project is made with Unity 2019.4 and is also tested in Unity 2022.3 and Unity 6. It's based on the Forward rendering path in the Built-in Render Pipeline.

The core implementation is located in the folder `Assets/Dither3D`. The remaining files relate to the Unity example project.

## Dither Properties

Each material that uses the dithering has the following dither-specific number properties:

**Dither Input Brightness**

- `Exposure`  
Exposure to apply to input brightness (default 1).
- `Offset`  
Offset to apply to input brightness (default 0).

**Dither Settings**

- `Dot Scale`  
Value that exponentially scales the dots.
- `Dot Size Variability`  
0 = shading controls dot count "Bayer style" (default);  
1 = shading controls dot sizes "half-tone style".
- `Dot Contrast`  
A value of 1 produces perfect anti-aliasing (default 1).
- `Stretch Smoothness`  
How much to smooth anisotropic dots (default 1).

**Global Options**

Furthermore, the following global toggle properties can be set via the `Dither3DGlobalProperties` component:

- `Color Mode`  
Can be set to Grayscale, RGB, CMYK or CGA. Grayscale converts the color to grayscale and runs the dithering once on that. RGB runs the dithering separately for the red, green and blue color channel. CMYK converts the color to CMYK, runs the dithering on each of those with traditional halftone rotations applied, and converts back to RGB. CGA runs the exact same grayscale dither once, then colors its dots Cyan, Magenta or White according to source luminance over a Black background.
- `CGA Cyan Hold`, `CGA Magenta Point`, `CGA White Point`
Control the luminance positions of the CGA dot-color ramp. Dots remain pure cyan through Cyan Hold, transition to pure magenta at Magenta Point, then transition to pure white at White Point. Black coverage continues to come from the unchanged grayscale dither pattern.
- `Inverse Dots`  
For Grayscale and RGB, disabled produces bright dots on dark background (recommended) while enabled produces dark dots on light background. For CMYK, disabled produces dark dots on light background (like ink) while enabled produces light dots on dark background. Here, disabled works best if the shapes of the individual dots are clearly visible, but it can produce significant banding. For smaller dot sizes, enabled is recommended.
- `Radial Compensation`  
When using a perspective camera, dots must be larger towards the edge of the screen in order to be stable under camera rotation. The Radial Compensation feature can be enabled to achieve this.
- `Quantize Layers`  
When disabled, dots may grow or shrink in size when they appear or disappear, respectively. Even when enabled, dots may still be partially cut off, but that's a separate and unavoidable effect.
- `Debug Fractal`  
Displays an overlay effect showing the pattern size, when enabled.

The `Dither3DGlobalProperties` component can also be used to override the non-global properties of all dither materials at once.

## Files

A brief overview of the files in the `Assets/Dither3D` folder:

The central shader include file with the dithering implementation:

- `Dither3DInclude.cginc`

Included shader files that use the dithering implementation:

- `Dither3DOpaque.shader`
- `Dither3DCutout.shader`
- `Dither3DParticleAdd.shader`
- `Dither3DSkybox.shader`

The dither shaders rely on a 3D texture with dither patterns. These come in several versions with different amounts of dots. In the materials using the dither shaders, you can freely switch between these 3D textures.

- `Dither3D_1x1.asset`
- `Dither3D_2x2.asset`
- `Dither3D_4x4.asset`
- `Dither3D_8x8.asset`

Although the 3D textures are available in the repository, a script is also included which can generate them from scratch. You can do this by using the menu items under the grouping `Assets/Create/Dither 3D Texture/...`. 

- `Dither3DTextureMaker.cs`

The script also generates PNG image files, where the different layers are laid out bottom to top. These PNG files are not used for anything and can be safely deleted, but they are easier to inspect and study than the native 3D textures. Note that later versions of Unity can in principle import 3D textures from such 2D images, but due to an inconsistency between Unity's 3D texture API and their 3D texture importer, the layers will appear in reverse order if this is attempted, and this will cause the fractal dithering effect to not work.

## Discussion of surface-stable trait

Here is how I define surface-stable:

- A specific dot "sticks" to the surface whose shading it is part of, both under object movement and camera movement.
- When a pattern is enlarged on the screen, for example due to zooming in on a surface, additional dots may be added to maintain the desired dot density, but no dots may be removed. Likewise, when a pattern shrinks on the screen, dots may be removed, but no dots may be added.

Conforming to the second constraint is in particular what is new in Surface-Stable Fractal Dithering. Approaches that fade between different scales of a pattern, which is not self-similar in the required way, will typically see dots both appearing and disappearing when zooming in.

### Bayer matrices

My implementation conforms to the second constraint by exploiting a certain "fractal" property of Bayer matrices, as explained in the video above.

### Other regular patterns

Some people have suggested using other regular patterns than Bayer for the dithering, based on triangles, hexes, square root 2 ratio rectangles, or similar. This should be relatively straightforward to implement for someone who so desires.

### Blue noise patterns

Some people have suggested using blue noise for the pattern. But it is not straightforward to construct a blue noise pattern which is self-similar in a way that conforms to the second surface-stable constraint.

If we use only a single tiled square of blue noise pattern, it would require the dots in each quadrant of the pattern, and each recursive quadrant of the pattern, to perfectly line up with dots in the full pattern, when scaled up to cover the same area as the full pattern.

Some people have pointed to the paper "Recursive Wang Tiles for Real-Time Blue Noise" by Johannes Kopf et al ([paper](https://johanneskopf.de/publications/blue_noise/paper/Recursive_Wang_Tiles_For_Real-Time_Blue_Noise.pdf) and [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykACzjtR6rc)). While the paper describes their technique making use of self-similar blue noise patterns, the practical demonstration in the video shows dots fading both in and out while zooming in, so while I do not fully understand their technique in detail, it does not seem to conform to the second surface-stable constraint.

I hope others will manage to construct a tiled blue-noise pattern with the required properties.
